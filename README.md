# TicTacToe
Trying to find a buddy to play TicTacToe (X's and O's) with you? No need, play with your computer!

This is a simple java program that plays TicTacToe with the user.
The program has two AIs that are used when the player plays as 'X' and 'O' respectively.
The program is programmed such as it can never lose, so either the player will lose, or it will be a draw.

All contributions welcome.
