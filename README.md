# TicTacToe
Trying to find a buddy to play TicTacToe (X's and O's) with you? No need, play with your computer!

So, I believe this program can never lose. Either it's going to be a draw or the computer will win.
Ther are a lot of things to be added to this program.
1- The program doesn't terminate if someone wins.
2- Maybe the AI could be improved.
3- If the user chooses an invalid move, the program terminates, maybe there's a way to keep the board intact and ask the user to enter again.

All contributions welcome.
